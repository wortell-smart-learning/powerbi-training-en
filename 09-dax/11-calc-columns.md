# 09 Calculated Columns in DAX

With *calculated columns* you can have a calculation performed in a column for each row of a table. We saw an example of this in the previous module, where in each row in the product table the corresponding subcategory and category was looked up via the `RELATED` function.

In this module we look at other possibilities of _calculated columns_.

##  Preparation

Let's continue with the report we built on a CSV file.

## Calculations

When defining _calculated columns_ you can use a whole arsenal of DAX functions. From very advanced (which actually run a new query for every row in the table) to basic functions such as addition and subtraction.

Below are a few commands - see how far you can solve them with a _calculated column_:


* In the table "Sales" we want a new column with subtotal including taxes
* In the table "Product" we want a new column with an indicator if a product is red in color
* In the "Product" table we want a grouping of _listprice_.
  * Column name: "price_segment_code"
  * _listprice_ = 0 -> _Blank_
  * _listprice_ between 0 and 1000 -> 1
  * _listprice_ between 1000 and 2000 -> 2
  * _listprice_ between 2000 and 3000 -> 3
  * _listprice_ between 3000 and 4000 -> 4
  * Try to get the display to show as an integer in the data model
* In the table "Product" we also want to label the price segment
  * Column name: "price segment"
  * 0: "No money"
  * 1: "Cheap"
  * 2: "Less Cheap"
  * 3: "Duration"
  * 4: "Exorbitant"
* Now when you group the sales by price segment in a visualization, you will see that it is sorted alphabetically:

* Make sure this sort is based on the price_segment_code. *No need to use or modify DAX expressions here!*
* Then hide the column "price_segment_code"

## Visual adjustments

After adjusting these definitions and codes, it is time to adjust some things in your report.

* Go back to the *Report* view of Power BI, and add a new page here
* Make sure it will look like this.
   * Tip: you will also have to make some adjustments to the settings of your data model here ...
   * ... but you don't need to add extra DAX expressions, measues or calculated columns
